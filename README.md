# NHMQuotingTool
Tool for estimating repair and sales quotes for mobility equipment.

### Recent Updates
- Styled the sales quote buttons to match the repair tab.
- PDFs now include a short footer message and slightly larger text for a cleaner look.
- Sales quotes now support entering our cost, setting a profit margin and automatically
  calculating the customer price.
- When a sales item is chosen its configured cost and default selling price are loaded
  automatically. The tool calculates the profit margin between those values and shows
  it in an editable field so the margin or final price can be adjusted on the fly.
- Cost on sales items is now read-only and the customer price fields and quote output
  explicitly show values excluding VAT.
- Labour rate is now £15.25 per 0.5 hours with a minimum labour charge of £74.75
  applied per quote.
